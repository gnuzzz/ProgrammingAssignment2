## Computing the inverse of a square matrix and caches it

## Creates a special 'matrix' that caches inverse matrix value

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Returns a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
